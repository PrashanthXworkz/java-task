1. Java is object-oriented,secured and easy to run in the programmming language.Java contains class, objects, methods,variables datatypes.
        eg:class Chair{}.
	javac is compiler use to compile the program for execution process.If any error in the given byte code it will show in the compilation itself.It is compilation as a virtual mode
	in the JVM.
	        eg:javac Chair.java

2.JDK is a development tool is used to develop byte code in the system.It is used for compile time in the given byte code inside the JVM.
   JRE is used for runtime in the given bytecode in java .It is Executes the bytecode after the compilation is successful.
   JVM is a virual machine tool is used to run the both the compile and run time in the given byte code.these three are platform dependents and bytecode is platform independent.

3.   Arrays is nothing but an collected the data in the fiven class in java.We declare as arrays in java be like declare one variable with array notation after that initialize the 
      data.
	     eg: static String Vegetables[]={"carrot", "raddish" , "potato"};
		 After that we print in the main we use the index for the given array in the given bytecode.
		     eg:System.out.println(Vegetables[1]+ "" + Vegetables[2] + ""+Vegetables[3]);
			 limitations:It can used more data for the paricular array.
			                 For using the length for counting the array and declare as n.
							 index=n-1

4.Class is nothing but ban sequence of characters in java.It is declare as a class name
          eg:class Amazon{}
          object is a intialize with one variable is called an object.
               eg:static String name="Ravi";
         Signature of the class is called as declare particular method in the given byte code.
                eg:public static boolean search(int year){}

5. .java is write the given code in the english language and it is understand for us .
     .class is a file the given code is converted into a machine language and it understand only machine.
 
6. The given class in the file we declare a method is called a method signature.It contains returntype ,parameters and one method name in the given byte code of java.
       Eg:public static String Amazon(String Band ){}

7. Java is a high level,object-oriented programming languageand platform independent.

8. Java Id's are eclipse, compiler , netbeans,visual studio.

9.variables is a storing the data in the given code .There are 4 types 
         1. static variables-it is declare and initialize in the given class only not in method inside given class.
         2. parameter-it can be declare in the method().
         3.local variable-it can be defined in the methods ,main in the given class of java.
         4.simple variable

10. Class Doctar{
             static String name="manish";
			 static int age=34;
			 static double salary=40,000;
			 } inside given class we have declare a variables is called class variable.

12.1.java is oject-oriented
     2.it is easy to run 
     3.java is secured way to use.

11. there are 2 types in datatypes 
      1.primitive datatypes-there are int ,float,double,char,byte,boolean.
	  2. non-primitive datatypes-String.

16. class Market{
 static  String vegetables[]={"potato", "carrot" ,"beans" , "beetroot" , "onion"};
public static voi main(String Vegetable[]){
System.out.println("Main Started");
System.out.println(vegetables[0]+ " " + vegetables[1]+ " " +vegetables[2]+ " "+ vegetables[3] + " "+vegetables[4]);
System.out.println("Main ended");
}
}
